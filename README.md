From preparing and loading data to modeling, creating visuals, and building reports, you'll be guided through each step to ensure successful completion of the task.

Prepare Data for Analysis With Power BI

The first task involves preparing the data for input into Power BI. This may involve cleaning it, ensuring it is in the correct format, and ensuring any necessary data transformations have been performed.

At a minimum, such actions should cover:

Remove from the datasets any rows that do not generate business value.
Merge the FirstName and LastName fields in the DimCustomer table.
Additional modifications for further use of the data may be required.


Load Data Into Power BI

Once the data is properly prepared, it should be loaded into Power BI. This can be accomplished via several methods, such as direct database connections or importing from Excel or CSV files. The student can choose the most convenient way to upload data:

CSV files can be uploaded to Power BI.
Data from CSV files can be first loaded into a database and then into Power BI from this database.

Model Data With Power BI

After the data has been imported, the next step involves modeling it within Power BI. This includes:

Сreating relationships between tables
Creating measures
Optimizing the data model for performance

Create Power BI Visuals

With a robust data model in place, the next step is to create Power BI visuals based on this model. This could include bar charts, pie charts, maps, and any other visuals that are needed to represent the data effectively. Pay attention to the use of colors, labels, and filters to make the visuals easy to understand and use.

During this step, consider incorporating:

At least five measures to help quantitatively describe the process
Filled map visualization to display the number of sales by country. Use a gradient fill to reflect the total number of products sold in the countries.
A pie chart to display the percentage of sales by country
A column chart to display the distribution of purchases by age
A line chart to display the number of units sold in each product category
Three to five more visualizations as you see fit

Build Power BI Reports

The last step involves building Power BI reports. This includes the crucial step of arranging visuals on the report canvas, making sure they are aligned properly and grouped logically. Logical grouping is a key aspect that helps make the report navigable and comprehensive to end users. This is often achieved through structured drill-down features and explanatory text boxes.

Then, select the most appropriate visualizations and place them on a separate page. Make sure that all visualizations are synchronized—for example, when you click on a country on the map, the visualization should display data related to that country.
